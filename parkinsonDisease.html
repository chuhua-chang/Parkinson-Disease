    <h1>What is Parkinson's Disease?</h1>
    <p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that is characterised by motor
      symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. With over 10 million people affected, there is an urgent need
      to search for therapeutics to slow down, halt or prevent this debilitating neurological disorder (Source:
      Parkinson's Foundation).</p>

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Parkinson's Disease is clinically diagnosed by the presentation of motor symptoms, while several non-motor
        symptoms may be manifested years before diagnosis. Signs and symptoms of PD include (but not limited to):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Action Tremor</li>
        <li>Bradykinesia</li>
        <li>Rigidity in the limbs</li>
        <li>Postural Instability</li>
        <li>Cognitive Decline</li>
        <li>Autonomic Dysfunction</li>
        <li>REM Sleep Disorder</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Genetic risk factors</li>
        <li>Environmental exposures to toxins and pesticides</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hallmarks of PD</h2>
      <p>PD involves the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of midbrain, while remaining
        neurons contain aggregated alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies.</p>
